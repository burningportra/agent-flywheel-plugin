# agent-flywheel

Multi-agent coding flywheel for Claude Code. Implements the Agentic Coding Flywheel: deep planning, parallel execution, and guided review gates - all using Claude Code's native Agent tool, skills, hooks, and MCP servers.

Repository: https://github.com/burningportra/agent-flywheel-plugin

## What it does

agent-flywheel drives a complete development cycle:

1. **Scan** - profiles the repository (languages, frameworks, TODOs, key files)
2. **Discover** - generates ranked improvement ideas based on the codebase
3. **Plan** - creates implementation tasks (beads) with optional deep planning via 3 parallel AI models
4. **Implement** - spawns sub-agents in isolated git worktrees per bead
5. **Review** - fresh-eyes review by 5 parallel agents per bead
6. **Repeat** - loops through all beads with drift checks between rounds

## Installation

Prerequisites: [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) (latest) and Node.js 18.18+.

```
/plugin marketplace add burningportra/agent-flywheel-plugin
/plugin install agent-flywheel@agent-flywheel
/reload-plugins
/agent-flywheel:flywheel-setup
```

`/agent-flywheel:flywheel-setup` detects missing tools and offers to install them. If multiple are missing, it offers a one-shot install of the full [ACFS stack](https://github.com/DavidSchargel/dicklesworthstone-acfs-stack-for-macos).

**Required:** [br](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_rust) (bead tracker), [bv](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) (bead viewer), [agent-mail](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail) (multi-agent coordination)

**Recommended:** [ntm](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/ntm) (parallel sessions), [dcg](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/destructive_command_guard) (safety guard), [cass](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search) (session search), [cm](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/cass_memory_system) (agent memory)

## Quick start

```
/agent-flywheel:start
```

That's it. The flywheel scans your repo, proposes improvements, plans, implements, and reviews.

**Key design decisions:**

- **CC Agent tool handles all parallelism** - no subprocess spawning. `Agent(isolation: "worktree")` replaces WorktreePool. `run_in_background: true` replaces SwarmTender polling.
- **MCP server is stateless** - state lives in `.pi-flywheel/checkpoint.json`. The server reads and writes it atomically.
- **Commands drive the conversation** - each `.md` file instructs Claude how to run the flywheel workflow, ask the user questions, and call the MCP tools.
- **agent-mail handles coordination** - file reservations prevent concurrent writes; messaging lets agents report progress.
- **Structured logging via `createLogger`** - all diagnostic output writes JSON lines to stderr (`FW_LOG_LEVEL` controls verbosity). Never touches stdout, keeping the MCP JSON-RPC channel clean.
- **SwarmTender auto-escalation** - `SwarmTender` monitors agent health and automatically nudges stuck agents (up to `maxNudgesPerPoll` per poll cycle, default 3), then kills and emits `onSwarmComplete` after `killWaitMs`. Opt-in via `flywheelAgentName`; backward compatible when unset.
- **Structured error contracts** - every `flywheel_*` tool returns errors as tagged `FlywheelErrorCode` codes (16 codes: `missing_prerequisite`, `invalid_input`, `cli_failure`, `exec_timeout`, `concurrent_write`, `empty_plan`, etc.) inside a Zod-validated envelope. The SKILL.md orchestrator branches on `result.data.error.code` instead of string-matching. `FlywheelError` class threads tagged errors through deep helper frames; `classifyExecError` maps raw exec rejections to the right code.

## Tool name deprecation

The MCP tools were renamed from `orch_*` to `flywheel_*`. The `orch_*` names remain registered as deprecated aliases for back-compat with legacy installs and dispatch to the same runners. They will be removed in v4.0 — prefer the `flywheel_*` names.

## Install from source (contributors)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/burningportra/agent-flywheel-plugin.git
cd agent-flywheel-plugin
npm ci --prefix mcp-server
npm run build --prefix mcp-server
claude --plugin-dir .
```

After editing `mcp-server/src/`, rebuild with `npm run build --prefix mcp-server` and commit the updated `mcp-server/dist/` in the same PR. The `dist-drift` CI job enforces this.
